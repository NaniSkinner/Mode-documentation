**Token Distribution Details**

Total supply of 10,000,000,000 tokens. The token supply is fixed.

In Year 1, Mode Foundation's core goal is to distribute tokens to users and developers that grow the ecosystem in addition to developing the onchain treasury. From Year 2 onwards governance will manage distributions.

The Mode foundation estimates the total supply of circulating MODE tokens to increase as [detailed in this sheet (opens new window).](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iU4irsKAIhLdNqkJCC00gMmwVZD_L9nxJOsYqk9Dl9c/edit#gid=470961921)
