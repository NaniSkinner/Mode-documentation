<summary>☢️ <strong>Programatically Deposit via the Mode Bridge</strong> </summary>

Bridging to Mode Mainnet Programatically is for experienced users only:\
\
\- **Only send ETH from the Ethereum Mainnet network:** Sending ETH from any other network will also result in unrecoverable loss of assets.\
\
\- **Do not send from Centralized Exchanges:** The bridge sends the ETH to the address that sent the ETH. If you send from an exchange, you will lose your assets and they will be sent to the exchange's address in Mode Network resulting in unrecoverable loss.\
\
In order to bridge you just need to send ETH to the Bridge contract in the Ethereum Mainnet network and it will bridge the tokens to the Mode Mainnet network. Please note that this process might take up to 10 minutes to complete.\

This is the Mainnet Bridge address on Ethereum:\
