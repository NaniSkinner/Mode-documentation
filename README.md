# ðŸŸ¡ Introducing Mode

#### Introduction

Mode is at the forefront of a transformative shift in decentralized finance (DeFi), evolving into the realm of **AiFi**â€”a novel, AI-powered financial ecosystem. At its core, AiFi represents a new wave of DeFi automation, where AI agents interact seamlessly on-chain, executing tasks such as MEV searching, arbitrage, and smart contract auditing. This enables the creation of scalable, efficient, and non-custodial financial services that operate beyond human constraints.

Our vision extends DeFiâ€™s boundaries with **AI-to-AI (AI2AI) interactions**, where intelligent agents perform complex financial tasks autonomously. This shift opens new opportunities, allowing more scalable DeFi systems that enhance transaction throughput, precision, and security. As AI agents evolve, they will not only optimize yields and liquidity but will also autonomously participate in and evolve on-chain economies.

Mode's is working to support this **AIFi economy**, leveraging partnerships, innovations, and integrations to drive the seamless adoption of AI-driven solutions across various DeFi protocols. This positions Mode at the intersection of AI and decentralized finance, as we build towards an economy driven by autonomous AI agents.

To learn more about our approach and the ongoing development in AiFi, explore our [Mode Mirror article](https://mode.mirror.xyz/avS1jdLLM8Ng0yIkcSstssMABmcS4Xgu72aNaFRSI6A).

### Low Fees

Mode has implemented Optimism's Bedrock upgrade which has significantly reduced the fees to be over 95% less than Ethereum. This makes it fast and cheap to use, great for end-user dApps!

### [â€‹Contributing to the Superchain](https://docs.base.org/#open-source)

Mode is powered by the [OP Stack](https://stack.optimism.io/), in collaboration with Optimism. We aim to contribute to growing Optimism's Superchain ecosystem as the main Agentic DeFi hub.
